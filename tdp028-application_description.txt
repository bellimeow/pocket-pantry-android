Minimizing your food waste and helping you our financially. If you are on a specific diet this will also help you keep track on what you eat. You can also store expire dates on some products to recieve notifications to use it in your cooking before it expires.

Imagine a scenario where a family wants to make their favorite apple pie and instead of writing it down and searching for the recipe they can easily look it up in their application in their favorite tab. They then select the recipe to add the required items to their shopping list. They uncheck the sugar since they already have that at home and they are then ready for a trip to the grocery store!
